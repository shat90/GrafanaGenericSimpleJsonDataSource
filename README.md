# GrafanaGenericSimpleJsonDataSource
 .NET Core sample for JSON DataSource for Grafana

 This is a basic implementation with a repository for creating a .NET Core API that would work with Grafana

 This uses the new JSON DataSource(https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/simpod-json-datasource ) and is also almost compatible with (https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-simple-json-datasource)
